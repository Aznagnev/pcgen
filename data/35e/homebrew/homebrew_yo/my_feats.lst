#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Feat File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the feats file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example

#Skill Focus		TYPE:General		DESC:See Text		MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILLSNAMED|TYPE.Strength|TYPE.Dexterity|TYPE.Constitution|TYPE.Intelligence|TYPE.Wisdom|TYPE.Charisma		BONUS:SKILL|LIST|3		SOURCEPAGE:Feats.rtf

#####
#Each feat takes one line and the first field must be the feat's name. In the Example the name of the feat is Skill Focus.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names feats which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.

Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

Chaos Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:The forces of chaos assist you in combat.																BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can summon the force of chaos to aid you. When you activate this ability, roll 1d6. If the result is odd, add that number as a sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on your attack rolls until your next action. If the result is even, add that number as a sacred or profane bonus to your AC. At the beginning of each action thereafter, roll the die again and apply the designated bonus.

BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can call upon the forces of destruction to weaken your opponents' defenses. If you deal damage with a melee attack (but not a melee touch attack) while this ability is active, you temporarily reduce the struck opponent's armor bonus or natural armor bonus by 1. Reductions from multiple hits stack, to a minimum bonus of +0. If the opponent has both armor and natural armor bonuses, it chooses which one to reduce. Once one bonus reaches +0, the other bonus automatically gets reduced until it too reaches +0 or the effect ends. This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which all armor and natural armor bonuses reduced in this way return to normal. Upon reaching 10th level, you reduce your opponent's armor or natural armor bonus by 2 per successful hit. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Earth Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can manipulate the earth to your advantage.														BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of difficult terrain or make terrain near you more difficult to move through. If you use this ability on yourself, you can ignore the effects of difficult terrain for 1 minute. This ability also grants you a +5 sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks. If you use this ability to affect nearby terrain, you can change one 5-foot square of earth or stone from normal to difficult terrain for every three character levels you possess (minimum 1 square; maximum 6 squares at 18th level). The first square you change must be within 30 feet of you, and all other squares must be linked to that one in an unbroken line. Thus, the second square must be adjacent to the first, the third must be adjacent to the first or second, and so on. This change lasts for 1 minute. On attaining 10th level, you can cause stone spikes to grow from any surface you have changed to difficult terrain using this ability. These spikes work like caltrops (PH 126), except that the bonus on attack rolls for each spike equals your base attack bonus, and they cannot be swept away. This effect also lasts 1 minute. If you cause spikes to appear underneath a creature on the affected surface, they immediately “attack.” Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Evil Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:The power of evil cloaks you and your allies.															BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can surround yourself with an aura of evil that grants you and each of your allies within 30 feet damage reduction that can be overcome only by good-aligned weapons. The numeric value of this damage reduction is 1 + 1/five character levels you possess (maximum 5/good at 20th level). In addition, your and your allies' natural and weapon attacks are evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Fire Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can burn your enemies with your melee attacks.														BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can sheathe your body in red and orange flames. The fire does not harm you, but you illuminate the nearby area as a torch would. While you are thus alight, each of your melee attacks deals 1 extra point of fire damage + 1 point for every three character levels you possess (maximum +7 at 18th level). This effect lasts for 1 minute. Any foe injured by this fi re ignites and burns for an additional 1d4 points of fi re damage per round unless it succeeds on a Refl ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). A burning creature can take a move action to automatically douse the flames. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each two daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Good Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:The power of good shields you and your allies.															BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can surround yourself with an aura of good that grants you and each of your allies within 30 feet damage reduction that can be overcome only by evil-aligned weapons.

You can activate this feat as an immediate action or, if you have a daily available, it automatically activates if you are reduced to 0 hit points or below (but not killed). Special: As a full-round action, you can transfer this ability to a willing recipient as a touch spell. Doing so counts as one daily use of the ability. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Knowledge Devotion							TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can use your knowledge to exploit your foes' weaknesses and overcome their strengths.				BENEFIT:Upon selecting this feat, you immediately add one Knowledge skill of your choice to your list of class skills. Thereafter, you treat that skill as a class skill, regardless of which class you are advancing in. Whenever you fight a creature, you can make a Knowledge check based on its type, as described on page 78 of the Player's Handbook, provided that you have at least one rank in the appropriate Knowledge skill. You then receive an insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature type for the remainder of the combat. The amount of the bonus depends on your Knowledge check result, as given on the following table (See pg. 60 Complete Champion) You can make only one Knowledge check per creature type per combat. If you fi ght creatures of multiple types during the same combat, you can make one Knowledge check per type, thereby possibly gaining different bonuses against different opponents.

Luck Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:Luck makes your attacks more effective.																BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can activate this ability to improve your combat prowess. For 1 minute, if the result of any damage roll you make is below average, you can increase it to one-half the maximum possible (rounded up).

Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Magic Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You channel your faith into a bolt of energy that strikes your target from afar.						BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can launch an energy bolt as a ranged touch attack against a target within 30 feet, + 5 feet per two character levels you possess.

In addition, you gain a slam attack as a natural weapon, and all your melee attacks (natural or not) gain the adamantine property for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it.

Sun Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:Your weapon blazes with the power of the sun.															BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can cause one of your melee weapons to glow with the power of the sun. The illumination radius is the same as that of a torch, but the light is true sunlight and affects creatures within a 10-foot radius as such. This effect lasts for 1 minute. While your weapon glows, it deals an additional 1 point of sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) damage per character level you possess to any undead it strikes. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Travel Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can move quickly around the battlefield.															BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can activate this ability to move up to your speed as a swift action each round. Thus, you can move your speed and then take a fullround action, or move and take two other actions (two move actions or one move action and one standard action). This effect lasts for 1 minute. Special: You cannot take a 5-foot step in the same round that you use this feat to move as a swift action. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each two daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Trickery Devotion							TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You project a simulacrum of yourself that can perform limited tasks.									BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can create an exact duplicate of yourself up to 30 feet away. You can control this simulacrum's movements as a free action. The image becomes more “real” as you advance in level. This ability is usable up to a maximum of 1 minute per level each day. The simulacrum combines the characteristics of the silent image (PH 279) and unseen servant (PH 297) spells. Its hit points are equal to 6 + your character level. It ignores terrain effects and moves like an unseen servant, making no noise in the process, though it makes normal motions while traveling. If you have a fly speed, the image appears to fly when not in contact with the ground; otherwise, it walks on open air. You can do anything with this image that you could do with the unseen servant spell and are under the same limitations. When you attain 5th level, you gain more control over the simulacrum. At this point, it behaves more like a major image spell (PH 252), though it still performs actions like an unseen servant. As long as the simulacrum remains within 5 feet of your position (and you can direct it to do so as a free action), you can perform a Bluff check in combat as a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on this check, which is opposed by your opponents' Sense Motive checks. If you are successful, your foes believe the image is you (and vice versa) for 1 round. Once you reach 10th level, you can spend a swift action to transfer your perceptions to the simulacrum and perceive the world from its point of view rather than your own. You can move the image as if it were your own body, using the simulacrum's movement characteristics (ignoring terrain, “f lying,” and the like). You can also perform any skill and ability checks using the simulacrum, as long as they do not require a Strength score higher than 2. The image has phantom versions of all your equipment (such as lockpicks), but any such items that lose direct contact with it immediately dissipate. When you attain 15th level, the image can become more “real” at your command. It gains a Strength score equal to one-half your own and can perform combat actions using phantom versions of your gear. Any of these items that lose contact with the image dissipate immediately. Thus, the image can wield a sword, but if it shoots a bow, the arrow disappears as soon as it is fi red. Equipment that extends more than 5 feet from the image (such as a length of rope) also disappears beyond that distance. In addition, you can now cast spells originating from the image as if with a project image spell (PH 265), with one exception. If you lose line of effect to the image, the effect does not end; you just can't cast spells originating from the image until you gain line of effect again. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
War Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can control your abilities more effectively in combat.												BENEFIT:Once per day, when fighting defensively as a standard or full-round action, you take a –3 penalty on all attack rolls in a round and gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC in the same round. When you attain 7th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to –2 and your dodge bonus increases to +4. When you attain 15th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to –1 and your dodge bonus increases to +5. This bonus stacks with the bonus to AC granted by the Combat Expertise feat. This benefi t is an extraordinary ability. Normal: When fi ghting defensively, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Water Devotion								TYPE:General		COST:1			DESC:You can create a water guardian.																		BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can pour the contents of a full waterskin on the ground and summon forth a water elemental on that spot. The creature remains and follows your commands for 1 minute. The size of the elemental is based on your character level, as given in the table below. (See Complete Champion pg. 64) Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.

For example, a character with this feat and a base attack bonus of +18/+13/+8/+3 could make four attacks per round with his primary weapon and four attacks per round with his off-hand weapon, using the same set of base attack bonuses. You still take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons.
