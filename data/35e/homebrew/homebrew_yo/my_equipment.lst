#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Equipment File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical listing
#of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example

#Dagger		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Finesseable.Ranged.Thrown.Simple.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.Dagger		COST:2	WT:1		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:2		DAMAGE:1d4		EQMOD:STEEL		WIELD:Light		RANGE:10	SIZE:M

#####
#
#####2nd Example

#Saddlebags		TYPE:Goods.Container.Mount.Resizable		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Any=UNLIM	COST:4	WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:Equipment.rtf

#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.

#Flasks
Alchemist’s Fire								TYPE:Goods.General.Liquid.Flask.Consumable											COST:20	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.127																												SPROP:You can throw a flask of alchemist’s fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire. 
Acid Flask										TYPE:Goods.General.Liquid.Flask.Consumable											COST:10	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.127																												SPROP:You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

Chronocharm Chain								TYPE:Amulet.Container		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Type.Chronocharm			COST:0	WT:0					SOURCEPAGE:MagicItemsCompendium.rtf
Chronocharm of the Celestial Wanderer			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.85																																																																																														SPROP:A chronocharm of the celestial wanderer slows your perception of time, allowing you a second chance to recognize potential danger. When you activate this chronocharm, you can immediately reroll a single Listen or Spot check that you just attempted. The result of the second roll replaces the first result. This ability functions once per day.
Chronocharm of the Fateweaver					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.85																																																																																														SPROP:A chronocharm of the fateweaver slows your perception of time, letting you avoid an ill-advised step. When you activate this chronocharm, you can immediately reroll a single Balance, Climb, or Tumble check that you just attempted. The result of the second roll replaces the first result. This ability functions once per day.
Chronocharm of the Grand Master					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.86																																																																																														SPROP:A chronocharm of the grand master slows your perception of time, allowing you to better dodge an incoming ranged attack.

Chronocharm of the Horizon Walker				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.86																																																																																														SPROP:Like other chronocharms, this item slows your perception of time for a specific, singular purpose. When you activate a chronocharm of the horizon walker, you can move up to half your speed as part of the same swift action used to activate it; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the distance you can move, round down to the nearest 5-foot increment. This ability functions once per day.
Chronocharm of the Laughing Rogue				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.86																																																																																														SPROP:First imagined by skilled temple raiders devoted to Olidammara, the god of rogues, chronocharms of the laughing rogue have found their way into the toolboxes of thieves of all stripes. When you activate this chronocharm, you can immediately reroll a single Disable Device skill check that you just attempted. You can activate this item after the success or failure of the first roll has been determined (even if your failure resulted in accidentally setting off a trap), but before any ramifications of that roll have been applied. The result of second roll replaces the first result. This ability functions once per day.
Chronocharm of the Uncaring Archmage			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.Chronocharm			COST:500	WT:0										SOURCEPAGE:MIC.86																																																																																														SPROP:A chronocharm of the uncaring archmage alters your perception of time, allowing you to cast a single spell more quickly. When it is activated, the next spell of 3rd level or lower you cast that has a casting time of 1 full round can be cast as a standard action instead. If you don’t cast such a spell by the end of your turn, the effect fades. This ability functions once per day.
